				<h2>SLIP INFORMATION</h2>
				
				<p>There are a total of 64 slips available, available in fully covered, partially covered, and uncovered variants. We offer 20' to 70' slips with a large breakwater, an easily accessable fuel pier, and shore power for each slip up to 120 volts.</p>
				
				<p>Specific slips also offer dock boxes for dry storage of your ropes or crabbing gear. With proper licenses, both crabbing and fishing are allowed off our docks as well.</p>

				<h2>ACCESS AND NAVIGATION</h2>
				
				<p>Deception Pass Marina lies at the edge of the San Juan Islands, and acts as a great stopping access point for those traveling through Deception Pass.</p>

				<p>Waters through the pass can exceed 9 knots. The currents create massive whirlpools and eddies that can easily alter the course of heavy displacement vessels. Standing waves can reach 8 to 10 feet under maximum current, and when they’re coupled with an opposing wind and/or storm surge. Tugboats with a cargo tow, and low-powered sailboats, avoid the pass except at the hand of an expert captain and in the small window of slack tide.</p>
				
				<p>When entering the marina, please take note of no-wake signs and water depths. Larger yachts should enter and depart in deep water area and watch the tidal charts.
